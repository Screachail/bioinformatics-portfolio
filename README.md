# Kacper Szafraniec | Bioinformatics & Data Engineering Portfolio

## Medical Biotechnologist → Product Owner and Business Systems Analyst → Data Engineer | Genomics & Healthcare IT

## About Me

I am a dedicated bioinformatics professional with a strong foundation in medical biotechnology and a proven track record in healthcare IT. My journey began with 5 years of hands-on wet lab experience in NGS sequencing, biobanking, and stem cell research at RCNT, where I developed deep technical expertise in genomics workflows. I hold an M.Sc. in Medical Biotechnology from the Medical University of Łódź and have successfully transitioned into data engineering, combining my domain knowledge with technical skills to drive innovation in healthcare data solutions.

My career path reflects a strategic evolution from laboratory research to product ownership and business systems analysis at MARCEL S.A., a leading Polish healthcare IT company. This diverse background has equipped me with both the scientific rigor and business acumen necessary to bridge the gap between complex biological data and practical healthcare applications. I maintain a personal development blog "MonuMentalnie" for 10 years, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and knowledge sharing in the field.
